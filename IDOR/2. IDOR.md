### **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**  

IDOR occurs when an application exposes direct access to objects based on user input without proper authorization checks. This allows attackers to access or modify data they shouldn't have permission to.  

#### **Key Observations & Techniques for Finding IDOR**  

1. **Hidden Fields in JSON**  
   - Even if certain fields are not explicitly included in the request (especially in `PUT` and `POST` requests), try adding them manually to see if the backend accepts them.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "12345",
       "role": "admin"  // Manually added to check if access level changes
     }
     ```
   - If the backend does not validate user permissions properly, this could escalate privileges or allow unauthorized data modifications.  

2. **UUIDs Can Be Deceptive**  
   - Sometimes, what looks like a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is actually:  
     - A **Base64-encoded value** containing predictable information.  
     - A **sequential identifier** where only the last segment changes (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` â†’ `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001`).  
   - Example:  
     - An API request like:  
       ```
       GET /api/orders/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
       ```
     - If changing the last few digits grants access to another user's order, it's a sign of IDOR.  

#### **Testing for IDOR**  
- **Modify identifiers** in request parameters (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.) and observe if unauthorized data is accessible.  
- **Try adding extra fields** to requests and see if the backend accepts them.  
- **Decode Base64 values** to check if they reveal predictable information.
