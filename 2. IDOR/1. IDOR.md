### Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Definition:**
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is a type of vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes internal implementation objects to users. This can allow attackers to bypass authorization and gain access to resources that they should not be able to access.

**Key Concepts:**
- IDOR vulnerabilities often arise from improper validation of user input and authorization checks.
- Attackers can manipulate URLs, parameters, or API calls to gain unauthorized access to resources.
  
**Common Examples:**
1. **File Download Manipulation:**
   - If a web application allows users to download files based on a parameter (e.g., `/download.php?file=123`), an attacker could manipulate the `file` parameter to access files they shouldn't be able to. 
   - **Example:**
     - Original request: `/download.php?file=123`
     - Attacker modifies to: `/download.php?file=456` (where 456 refers to a sensitive file)

2. **Direct Object Access:**
   - Consider an API endpoint that returns user information based on an ID parameter (e.g., `/api/users/123`). An attacker can change the ID to access information of other users.
   - **Example:**
     - Original request: `/api/users/123`
     - Attacker modifies to: `/api/users/124` (where 124 is another user's ID)

3. **Sensitive File Access:**
   - An attacker may try to access sensitive files by manipulating URLs or paths.
   - **Example:**
     - Original request: `/files/document.pdf`
     - Attacker modifies to: `/files/../../etc/passwd` to try accessing the `/etc/passwd` file.

**What to Look For:**
- **Parameter Manipulation:** Check if modifying parameters in URLs or API requests results in unauthorized access to resources.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** Ensure that the application properly verifies whether the user has permission to access specific objects.
- **Resource Exposure:** Be aware of endpoints that expose sensitive resources without adequate access control.
- **Predictable Object References:** Identify if the application uses predictable identifiers (like sequential IDs) that could be easily guessed.
- **Access Control Mechanisms:** Assess the robustness of access control mechanisms in place (e.g., role-based access control).

**Testing Techniques:**
1. **Fuzzing Parameters:** Use fuzzing tools to automate the testing of different parameter values to identify unauthorized access.
2. **Directory Traversal:** Test for directory traversal vulnerabilities by manipulating file paths in download requests.
3. **API Endpoint Testing:** Check API endpoints for user data exposure by modifying user IDs in requests.

**Conclusion:**
As a bug bounty hunter, it is crucial to think creatively and methodically when testing for IDOR vulnerabilities. Focus on user permissions, input validation, and the overall security posture of the application to identify potential weaknesses.

### Additional Considerations for IDOR in Bug Bounty Hunting

1. **Authorization Logic Flaws:**
   - Understand that IDOR vulnerabilities often stem from flawed authorization logic. Assess how the application determines what resources a user is allowed to access. Look for inconsistent or missing checks that could allow unauthorized access.

2. **Contextual Awareness:**
   - Be aware of the context in which the application operates. Different users might have varying access levels, and the application's response could change based on the user’s role (e.g., admin vs. regular user).

3. **Business Logic Abuse:**
   - IDOR can sometimes be exploited by abusing business logic. Analyze the workflow of the application and consider how an attacker might manipulate processes or requests to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionalities.

4. **Rate Limiting and Enumeration:**
   - When testing for IDOR, consider the application’s rate limiting policies. Rapidly enumerating through IDs or parameters may trigger security mechanisms that could block your IP or account. Use a measured approach to avoid detection.

5. **Token and Session Handling:**
   - Review how the application handles tokens and sessions. Ensure that access control is maintained across sessions and that tokens are not reused or predictable. IDOR can sometimes exploit weak session management.

6. **Testing with Different User Roles:**
   - If the application has multiple user roles, test IDOR vulnerabilities using accounts with different permissions. This helps to uncover potential access paths that might be available to users with elevated privileges.

7. **Third-Party Dependencies:**
   - Investigate third-party libraries or APIs that the application uses. They may also have IDOR vulnerabilities that can be exploited if proper checks are not implemented in the application.

8. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
   - Check if the application uses Access Control Lists for managing permissions. Ensure that the implementation of ACLs is robust and that users cannot bypass them through manipulation.

9. **Security Headers:**
   - Assess whether the application employs security headers that can mitigate IDOR attacks, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Content-Type-Options. These headers can help protect against certain types of exploitation.

10. **Logs and Monitoring:**
    - Be aware of logging and monitoring practices within the application. Some applications may log access attempts, including unauthorized ones. Understanding how the application monitors for abnormal behavior can influence your testing strategy.

11. **Reporting Findings:**
    - When reporting IDOR vulnerabilities, provide a clear and concise explanation of the issue, including steps to reproduce it, potential impact, and suggestions for remediation. This helps developers understand the severity and context of the vulnerability.


### **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**  

IDOR occurs when an application exposes direct access to objects based on user input without proper authorization checks. This allows attackers to access or modify data they shouldn't have permission to.  

#### **Key Observations & Techniques for Finding IDOR**  

1. **Hidden Fields in JSON**  
   - Even if certain fields are not explicitly included in the request (especially in `PUT` and `POST` requests), try adding them manually to see if the backend accepts them.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "12345",
       "role": "admin"  // Manually added to check if access level changes
     }
     ```
   - If the backend does not validate user permissions properly, this could escalate privileges or allow unauthorized data modifications.  

2. **UUIDs Can Be Deceptive**  
   - Sometimes, what looks like a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is actually:  
     - A **Base64-encoded value** containing predictable information.  
     - A **sequential identifier** where only the last segment changes (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` → `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001`).  
   - Example:  
     - An API request like:  
       ```
       GET /api/orders/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
       ```
     - If changing the last few digits grants access to another user's order, it's a sign of IDOR.  

#### **Testing for IDOR**  
- **Modify identifiers** in request parameters (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.) and observe if unauthorized data is accessible.  
- **Try adding extra fields** to requests and see if the backend accepts them.  
- **Decode Base64 values** to check if they reveal predictable information.
